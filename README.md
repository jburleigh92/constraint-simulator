# constraint-simulator
Deterministic rule-based evaluator for facility eligibility and execution constraints.  This tool evaluates whether a warehouse facility qualifies for a narrowly scoped operational task based on explicit safety, layout, and governance constraints. It does not simulate behavior, autonomy, or execution.
